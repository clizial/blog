Critiques of the graph\r\nPlease see the graph and critiques from clarity and aesthetics aspects below.\r\n\r\nClarity\r\nThere is no overall title for the two data visualizations, it is unclear to audience what’s the key message the author would like to convey.\r\nThe graph’s legend is not clear, it states “Vac1”, but what exactly “Vac 1” presents is not clear to audience. Only for 1 and 5 it stated the context “Strongly agree” and “Strongly disagree”, the number 2, 3, 4 are not clear to audience what they’re representing.\r\nThe left graph and the right graph is not synced in terms of the sorting of the Y-axis where the left graph sort by alphabetical order and the right graph sort by the percentage of the people who strongly agreed.\r\nThere is no additional information provided in the second graph for the purpose of showing the strongly agree with sorting as it can be easily achieved in one graph by having the strongly agree at the starting and then sort it.\r\nAesthetics\r\nThe color used to present the strongly agree to strongly disagree does not show a good contrast and meaning, for example using green to presenting strongly disagree does not match with audiences’ usual cognition.\r\nBoth graphs X-axis’s are not standardized, graph 1 with no decimal place where graph 2 has 1 decimal place.\r\nThere is a typo in the graph 1 title where vaccine is spelled as “vacinne”.\r\nThe countries label is not with first letter capitalized, which is not professional.\r\n2. Sketch of the proposed design\r\nConcerning the critics above, I would like to suggest an alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Please see below for the sketch of the proposed design.\r\n\r\nThe proposed design has four main improvements and advantages.\r\nIt has a clearer header to tell the audience what’s the key message is trying to deliver.\r\nThe sorting for both graphs’ Y-axis is the same and audience can easily to cross reference for the 2 graphs.\r\nThe color of the graph will be in more contrast and reveal information about the responses.\r\nThe country names are capitalized.\r\nThe legend has made clearer and the audience knows what’s the question about and what does each color indicates.\r\nThe second graph is now more meaningful which shows the proportion of each country’s agreeness to the questions which includes “Strongly agree” and “Agree”.\r\nBoth graphs have the same decimal places for X-axis and make the entire dashboard standardized.\r\n3. Proposed data visualization designed in Tableau\r\nPlease see here for the proposed responsive data visualization.\r\n4. A step-by-step description of how the data visualization was prepared\r\nData preparation\r\nExtract the columns which we are interested in, select the column “vac_1”, “vac2_1”, “vac2_2”, “vac2_3”, “vac2_6”, “gender”, “age”, “household_size”, “household_children” for the 14 countries.\r\n\r\nUse union in tableau and import all data sets.\r\n\r\nRename the column names and data type to the following\r\n\r\nRename the file to Country and update the aliases. \r\nBreakdown of responses\r\nCreate parameter Survey questions as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Question Selector as the following\r\n\r\nEdit the Question Selector aliases as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Number of records as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Total count as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Percentage as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Score as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Count negative as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Total count negative as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Gantt start as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Gantt percent as the following\r\n\r\nDrag gantt percent to column and country to row\r\n\r\nRight click on gantt percent and change the compute using to Question Selector\r\n\r\nDrag the following to marks to the corresponding mark, and change it to gantt bar\r\n\r\nDrop the following to filters and click show filter\r\n\r\nRight click Survey questions and select show parameters.\r\nChange the filter option to range for age and single value (dropdown) for others.\r\nChange the title and the graph 1 is completed\r\n\r\nProportion of agreeness\r\nCreate calculation field Proportion as the following which is the proportion of both “Strongly Agree” and “Agree”\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Prop_SE as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Z_95% as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Prop_Margin of Error 95% as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Prop_Lower Limit 95% as the following\r\n\r\nCreate calculation field Prop_Upper Limit 95% as the following\r\n\r\nDrag Proportion and measure values to column and country to row, right click on any of the columns and select dual axis\r\n\r\nRemove other measure values and only remain upper and lower limit\r\n\r\nChange marks of measure values to path\r\n\r\nChange the AGG(Proportion) measure name to color and adjust the size and color\r\n\r\nChange all filters to be applied to all using this data source\r\n\r\nChange the title and graph 2 is completed\r\n\r\nDashboard\r\nGo to the dashboard and drag both sheets to the dashboard\r\nRearrange the filters positions\r\nAdd text as title to the dashboard\r\nAdd text as data source to the dashboard\r\nThe dashboard could be show as the following\r\n\r\n5. Three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared\r\nIn general, female is more acceptable and faithful to the vaccine compare to man, from the filtered graph of the proportion of agreeness in response to the question of “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it” and “I believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine”\r\n1.1 “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it”\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 “I believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine”\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople of age 70 and above are more willing to get vaccinated and less concerned about the side effects across all country compare to the younger age group, however at the same time the uncertainty at 95% is higher too. For example below is showing the response to “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it”.\r\n\r\nPeople in Japan are generally having a stronger negative emotion to COVID compared to others where they are more worried about getting COVID and worried about the side effect of the vaccine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my blog, hope you have a nice day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Clarity\r\nThe graph’s header is not clear and does not summarize and reveal the purpose and main idea of the graph. It could be clearer if it has a header that able to tell the audience the main purpose in a concise way and what the graph is revealing to the audience.\r\nThere is no Y-axis label to show the value and reference point, e.g. starting point 0. And the unit “Per Cent” is below the header which is too far away from the graph. It should have clear axes that audience able to read from the graph.\r\nUsing the line graph for age groups is a bad practice as age groups are not a continuous data type, and it can be misleading at points. It should use a bar chart or other suitable graph to present the categorical data.\r\nThe statement and the graph showing does not tally. That information stated in the statement cloud not be referred from the graph.\r\nAesthetics\r\nThe color used to present 2009 and 2019 are not with strong contracts, especially using grey is too weak for the comparison. It is advisable to use more vibrate colors to presenting for the 2009 and 2019 data.\r\nThe table below is with the background colour is redundant as the row name has already indicated the data with colour, it does not reveal or help with the visualization. It should highlight the difference where the audience should be paying more attention to.\r\nThe source and note text are not aligned, one at center and another left-aligned. Both should be aligned for a neater presentation.\r\n2. Sketch of the proposed design\r\nConcerning the critics above, I would like to suggest an alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. Please see below for the sketch of the proposed design.\r\n The proposed design has four main improvements and advantages.\r\nIt has a clearer header and telling the audience that the graph is a comparison between 2009 and 2019.\r\nThere is clear Y-axis and X-axis to show the differences and age group.\r\nThe dot graph is per category not continuous which is clearer and not misleading.\r\nThe colors to be used to present 2009 and 2019 data will be with strong contrast in vibrate colors.\r\n3. Proposed data visualization designed in Tableau\r\nPlease see below for the proposed data visualization. \r\n4. A step-by-step description of how the data visualization was prepared\r\nThe steps of creating the visualization shown above in the Tableau are as following: 1. Extract the defined age group data to an excel file named Labour Force participation rate, keeping the age group defined for 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70&over\r\nLoad the data to Tableau and enable Data Interpreter to interpret the column name\r\nSelect column 2009 to 2019 and pivot table\r\nRename the pivot field names to Year and data type to Date. Rename pivot field values to participation rate\r\nDrag [Age (Years)] to the Rows shelf\r\nDrag [Participation rate, %] to the Columns shelf\r\nDrag [Year] to Color on the marks card\r\nDrag [Year] to the Filter shelf\r\nIn the Filter Field dialog, select Years and click Next >\r\nIn the Filter dialog, check only 2009 and 2019 and click OK\r\nOn the marks card, in the drop-down, select Circle\r\nCreate a calculated field with the name “2009 Participation rate” with the calculation as the following: \r\nCreate a calculated field with the name “Difference” with the calculation as the following:\r\n\r\nDrag [2009 Participation rate] to the Columns shelf\r\nClick [2009 Participation rate] on the Columns shelf to open the SUM (2019 Participation rate) marks card\r\nIn the SUM (2009 Participation rate) marks card, do the following:\r\nIn the dropdown, select Gantt Bar\r\nRemove YEAR(Year) from Color\r\nDrag [Difference] to Size and adjust the thickness\r\nDrag [Difference] to label and add annotate point on the empty space and type difference, point the arrow to the difference label\r\nRight-click [2009 Participation rate] on the Columns shelf and select Dual Axis\r\nRight-click the Sales axis at the bottom of the view and select Move marks to front\r\nRight-click [2009 Participation rate] on the Columns shelf and un-check Show Header\r\nAdd it to the dashboard and add text boxes for header, description and source\r\n5. Three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared\r\nAll the labour force participation rate for each age group has increased from 2009 to 2019 except for the age group 20-24 with a decrease of 2.50%.\r\nThe labour force participation rate for younger age groups did not increase as much as the older age groups. The age group below 44 increased less than 5.00% and age groups above have increased more than 5.00% for most of them.\r\nThere is a trend of increment of differences in the labour force participation rate starting age group 50-54 until age group 65-69 from 2009 to 2019, and age group 65-69 with the most increase of 16.20%.\r\nThank you very much for reading my blog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
